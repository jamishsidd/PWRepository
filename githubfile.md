## Sub-Heading in a Github .MD File

### Starting a Subsection
Again, we are writing some text here! we can perform amazing formatting through several features, **like we can bold text on the go** we can *also italicise the text* as well.

we can also create lists formatting here:

* The list has one item
* The item number 2
* Another item
    * Now you have the sub-item
    * Sub-item 2
    * Sub-item 3
 
Another paragraph start here!

>**Note:** This can be a note to the File.

>**Note2:** This can be a Note 2.

You can also use Links easily in .md files, like [PWSkills](https://pwskills.com/).
